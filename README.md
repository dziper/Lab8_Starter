1) I would fit my automated tests within a Github Action that runs automatically. That way I don't have to be worried about forgetting to test when pushing code, and other contributors' code runs the same tests as mine.
2) No
3) No I would not. Testing the message feature of the application would likely require a more complex test than a simple unit test testing just one function, since there are multiple interacting users.
4) Yes I would. The max message length is just one function that could be easily tested on a variety of inputs without relying on other aspects of the app.
